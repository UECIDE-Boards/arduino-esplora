Description: Arduino Esplora
 The Arduino Esplora is a microcontroller board derived from the
 Arduino Leonardo. The Esplora differs from all preceding Arduino
 boards in that it provides a number of built-in, ready-to-use set
 of onboard sensors for interaction. It's designed for people who
 want to get up and running with Arduino without having to learn
 about the electronics first. For a step-by-step introduction to
 the Esplora, check out the Getting Started with Esplora guide.
 .
 The Esplora has onboard sound and light outputs, and several input
 sensors, including a joystick, a slider, a temperature sensor, an
 accelerometer, a microphone, and a light sensor. It also has the
 potential to expand its capabilities with two Tinkerkit input and
 output connectors, and a socket for a color TFT LCD screen.
 .
 Like the Leonardo board, the Esplora uses an Atmega32U4 AVR
 microcontroller with 16 MHz crystal oscillator and a micro USB
 connection capable of acting as a USB client device, like a mouse or
 a keyboard.
 .
 In the upper left corner of the board there is a reset pushbutton,
 that you can use to restart the board. There are four status LEDS :
 .
 *   ON [green] indicates whether the board is receiving power supply
 *   L [yellow] connected directly to the microcontroller, accessible
 through pin 13
 *   RX and TX [yellow] indicates the data being transmitted or
 received over the USB communication
 .
 The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller;
 simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable to get started.
 .
 The Esplora has built-in USB communication; it can appear to a
 connected computer as a mouse or keyboard, in addition to a virtual
 (CDC) serial / COM port. This has other implications for the behavior
 of the board; these are detailed on the getting started page.
